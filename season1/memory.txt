types of memory:
stack
heap


a=9,b=4 => this method write 9 to a and 4 on b section in monory blocks

but what memory does when we asign an array to a variable. in this position array data save in heap memory and then save heap memory address in stack memory


when you asign a block of data to in stack memory to heap memory .if that variabe deleted in stack memory , what will be happen to heap memory?
Garbage collector comes to the game in this part. garbage collector delete all unasigned heap memory
